### The Book class models a book with properties such as title, author, ISBN, and price. It includes methods to display the book's information and to apply a discount to the book's price. The class demonstrates encapsulation by making the book's attributes private and controlling access to them via its methods. Additionally, the class has two constructors: a no-argument constructor that initializes the book with default values, and a parameterized constructor to initialize it with specific values.
